In this folder we released:
1) The final ReFair prototype (as an executable python script);
2) A subfolder datasets that contain the knowladge mappings required to suggest the sensitive features (in relation to the predicted domain and ml tasks) and a copy of the USs dataset;
3) A subfolder models that contains the best models we trained after the experimentation (RQ1 & RQ2), required to predict the application domain and the machine learning tasks;
4) The "requirements.txt" file that contains all the dependencies to use ReFair;
5) An additional notebook that provide other details regarding the main rationale behind ReFair.
